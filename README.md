Customer Churn Prediction Model   
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By leveraging a real-world dataset, the project aims to identify customers at risk of leaving, uncover key factors driving churn, and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

üìä Project Overview  
Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, directly impacting revenue and growth. This project tackles this problem by building and evaluating a predictive model that can accurately classify customers as either "churn" or "no churn." The analysis follows a standard data science pipeline, including exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

‚ú® Key Features  
Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of the Telco Customer Churn dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with churn.

Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques and scaled numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

Multiple Model Evaluation: Explored and compared the performance of several classification models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Model Performance Metrics: Evaluated models using key metrics such as Accuracy, a Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score), and a Confusion Matrix.

Actionable Business Insights: Provided data-driven recommendations to help businesses develop effective retention strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack  
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas & numpy for data manipulation and numerical operations.

matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.

scikit-learn for machine learning model building and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebook for the entire analysis workflow.
